>
> - the application uses _Appwrite_ as a backend service for Authentication, Database, Storage and
>   Messaging, therefore you need to create account [here](https://appwrite.io/) and sets the
>   `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`, `APPWRITE_URL`, and `APPWRITE_API_KEY` environment variables in `.env`
>   file.
> - to understand how to design the Appwrite collections, refer to the
>   [Appwrite Types](https://github.com/ladunjexa/nextjs14-carepulse/blob/main/appwrite/types/index.d.ts)
>   file. add the following environment variables to the `.env` file: `APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID`,
>   `APPWRITE_STORAGE_ID`, `APPWRITE_PATIENT_COLLECTION_ID`, `APPWRITE_DOCTOR_COLLECTION_ID`, and
>   `APPWRITE_APPOINTMENT_COLLECTION_ID`.
> - the application uses _Sentry_ for Error Tracking and Monitoring, therefore, you need to create
>   Sentry account [here](https://sentry.io/) and sets the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable
>   in `.env` file.
> - the application uses _Twilio_ for SMS, therefore, you need to create Twilio account
